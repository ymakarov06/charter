The public debate over charter schools in the U.S. has been going on for a while and is still nowhere near conclusion. While charter schools are commonly praised as a viable alternative to traditional public early education, especially for minority students, the opponents often claim that the presence of charter schools within a public school district zone creates various challenges for the latter.

In most cases, school district administrators are worried about the competition with charters for public funding. In my work, however, I once encountered an interesting and somewhat surpirising claim that a single charter school in some wealthy area near San Jose was absorbing high income students, thereby leaving the district with a steadily increasinng share of socioeconomically disadvantaged students. The district was very much eager to document this trend and to attribute it to the presence of the charter school. Unfortunately, the data at hand did not allow us to make any causal claims that time, but I got curious to learn if there are any general patterns in how a school school demographic composition could possibly change once a charter opens in its zone. This small analysis is essentially an outline of a potential study.
